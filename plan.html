Target Audience

15-30
the way i will aim this site towards this age group is by making this page focus more on the social side of the sport.
my reasoning behind this is because the main portion of people who would want to get out and play volleyball would be attracted
towards not just the volleyball but the meeting of new people and of course the bar(maybe not the 15 year olds). the look I
want to create with this website to cater to these people would include nice bright colours yet still have a professional
clean and simplistic layout much like instagram and many other social media websites as these sites have been made by large
groups of experts with the soul purpose of luring in the same age group as this volleyball site will.

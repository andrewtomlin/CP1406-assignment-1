<h2>Who Can Play</h2>
<p>
    There are 800 million players worldwide who play volleyball at least once a week. Volleyball
    is a sport that is safe, fun and does not require extreme fitness. Since you don’t have to move around
    the court too much, it’s great for people who want a low-impact sport that will help them get fit
    without pushing them to their limit. For those who are a bit more competitive, the sport is
    fantastic because games can be really exciting and intense, but there’s always a net between you and your opponents.
    Beach volleyball is suitable for people of all ages, and men and women alike.
    Anyone considering starting a new sport or exercise program should see their doctor first.
